        THE COMPANY'S, OR THE APPLICABLE PROVIDER'S, OR THE APPLICABLE CRA REPOSITORIES' ACTS OR OMISSIONS,
        REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE
        CLAIM, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICES FOR THE ONE MONTH PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH
        YOUR CLAIM AROSE, OR U.S. $30.00, WHICHEVER IS

        These Terms and Conditions constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to the Sites and the

        contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Sites and
        the Services and any other subject matter
        covered by these Terms and Conditions. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right under or provision of
        these Terms and Conditions will not constitute a
        waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms and Conditions is found by a court of
        competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
        nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in
        the provision, and the other provisions of the
        Terms and Conditions will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign these Terms and Conditions or
        any of your rights or obligations under the
        Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions may be assigned by us and will inure to the benefit of our
        successors, assigns, and licensees. The section
        titles and headings in these Terms and Conditions are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
        effect. All of the Company's Providers are
        third party beneficiaries with respect to the provisions in these Terms and Conditions that reference them.
        All provisions in these Terms and Conditions
        that by their nature would survive termination or expiration of your access to the Sites or the Services
        subscription (including but not limited to those
        related to limits on our and our Providers' liability, your liability to us and our Providers,
        investigations, applicable law and venue, and our right to
        remove and discard your content from the Services) will survive such termination or expiration. In the event
        of cancelation, termination, or cessation for
        any reason of your membership in any of the Services, the introductory paragraph of this Agreement, sections
        1-4, and 16-28 of these Terms and Conditions
        will survive. In the event of a conflict between any other notice, policy, disclaimer or other term
        contained in this website, these Terms and Conditions
        will control. If any provision is deemed to be unlawful or unenforceable, it will not affect the validity
        and enforceability of the remaining provisions.
