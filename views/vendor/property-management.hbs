    <p>Property Owners who are not clients of the Rent Rite Directory’s do not have to register to
        receive these benefits, and the service is provided completely free of charge, unlike other
        referral websites. This ensures that the property management company that was referred, is RRD
        approved, and not just the highest paying company.
        In order to be connected with a Rent Rite Directory approved Property Management Company,
        interested owners can click here to request information on approved companies. Please provide
        the location of the property, type of property, number of units (if multifamily) and the contact
        information.</p>
