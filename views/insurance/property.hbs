    <p>Business property insurance is one of the most important investments ensuring the future of
        your business. Whether you own your building, lease your workspace or work at home, business
        property insurance protects your businessâ€™ physical assets.</p>

    <p>If a storm, fire, theft or other event damages your building, its contents,
        or any outdoor fixtures (like signs, fencing and landscaping), your business faces serious hardship.
        The cost to replace or repair buildings and equipment are often higher than you think,
        and if you're shut down until you can pay for repair or replacement your business could
        struggle to recover.</p>

    <p>Business property insurance can help pay to repair or replace what's been damaged,
        so you're able to recover and get back to work faster.</p>
